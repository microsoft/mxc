# Process Container: Adding OS Features

> **Audience:** MXC developers

This guide covers adding new OS-level features that flow through MXC's Windows
process container pipeline.

Supported networking uses directional egress/ingress,
`runtimeConfig.networkProxy`, and ProcessContainer proxy-peer identity. Retired
networking fields are rejected by every registered contract. Backend
selection depends on host capability and requested policy, not schema version.

For which policy aspects this backend can enforce on each Windows 11 release,
see [Windows OS-version policy support](../../backends/process-container/os-version-support.md).

## Prerequisites

1. Read the [supported configuration schema](../../schema.md) for policy and
   request fields.
2. Read [authoring-a-new-feature.md](authoring-a-new-feature.md), especially
   Step 1 (feature spec) and Step 2 (OS changes).
3. Submit a feature spec so reviewers understand the end-to-end flow.

## Architecture recap

For native Windows ProcessContainer, the executor flow is:

```text
MXC request JSON
  -> wxc-exec: version-specific parsing and request binding
    -> mxc_engine: native ProcessContainer eligibility
      -> BaseContainerRunner: builds a PSEC FlatBuffer
        -> CreateProcessSecurityEnvironment (processmodel.dll)
          -> CreateProcessW with PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY_ENVIRONMENT
            -> OS applies restrictions
```

The PSEC FlatBuffer is the contract between MXC and the OS process security
environment. New features must flow from the versioned config contract into the
runtime model and then into that FlatBuffer.

## Step-by-step

### 1. Update the OS PSEC schema and implementation

The source-of-truth schema and processmodel implementation live in the internal
Windows OS source tree. Add the new contract field, regenerate the OS bindings,
and implement the corresponding enforcement.

### 2. Update MXC's PSEC schema copy

Once the OS change is available on the target build, update:

```text
external/windows-sdk/ProcessSecurityEnvironment.fbs
```

Then regenerate the Rust bindings in:

```text
src/mxc-sdk/src/core/process_security_environment_spec/
```

### 3. Flow the policy through MXC

Update the exact development config contract, normalized wire model, runtime
model, and parser mapping. Follow
[authoring-a-new-feature.md](authoring-a-new-feature.md) and regenerate the
development schemas and generated SDK wire types rather than editing generated
artifacts by hand.

### 4. Build the PSEC specification

Update the helpers under
`src/mxc-sdk/src/backends/process_container/common/base_container_helpers.rs` to encode
the runtime policy into the PSEC FlatBuffer. Update
`BaseContainerRunner::can_backend_service_request()` so the native runner
is constructed only when the single request-level decision reports that the
runtime OS can enforce the complete request.

If PSEC cannot represent or enforce the request, reject it before creating a
container and return an actionable error. Do not fall back to AppContainer,
filesystem brokering, or host-DACL mutation, or silently omit a restriction.

### 5. Test end-to-end

Use a Windows build containing the processmodel change.

1. Add focused parsing and PSEC-construction tests.
2. Run `wxc-exec` with a config that enables the new field and verify the OS
   enforcement.
3. Exercise the corresponding SDK policy and verify the complete
   policy-to-OS flow.
4. Verify omission applies the intended secure default.
5. Verify an unsupported host rejects the request before container creation
   with an actionable error and without weakening policy.
6. Wire functional coverage into scheduled backend validation. For networking,
   extend `tests/scripts/run_base_container_network_tests.ps1`, including
   positive and negative controls.
