# LXC Container Backend

The LXC backend provides Linux container isolation using [LXC (Linux Containers)](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/).

## Overview

On Linux, MXC uses LXC to create lightweight containers for script execution. This provides:

- **Process isolation** via Linux namespaces (PID, mount, network, user)
- **Filesystem isolation** via bind mounts with read-only/read-write/denied enforcement
- **Network isolation** via iptables/nftables rules scoped to the container's virtual network interface

## Prerequisites

- Linux kernel 4.x or later
- LXC >= 5.0 installed (`liblxc-dev` for building, `lxc-utils` for runtime)
- Root privileges (or unprivileged LXC configured)

### Installation

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt install lxc lxc-utils liblxc-dev
```

**Fedora/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo dnf install lxc lxc-devel
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S lxc
```

## Configuration

The LXC backend uses the same JSON configuration schema as the Windows backends, with the `containment` field set to `"lxc"` and a required `lxc` section specifying the distribution and release:

```json
{
    "containerId": "my-sandbox",
    "containment": "lxc",
    "process": {
        "commandLine": "echo 'Hello from container'"
    },
    "lifecycle": {
        "destroyOnExit": true
    },
    "lxc": {
        "distribution": "alpine",
        "release": "3.20"
    },
    "filesystem": {
        "readwritePaths": ["/tmp/output"],
        "readonlyPaths": ["/opt/tools"],
        "deniedPaths": ["/etc/shadow"]
    },
    "network": {
        "defaultPolicy": "block",
        "allowedHosts": ["api.github.com"],
        "blockedHosts": ["evil.example.com"]
    }
}
```

### LXC-Specific Options

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `distribution` | string | **Yes** | Linux distribution for the container rootfs (e.g., `"alpine"`, `"ubuntu"`) |
| `release` | string | **Yes** | Distribution release version (e.g., `"3.20"`, `"24.04"`) |

### Supported Distributions

The `distribution` and `release` fields control which LXC template is used to create the container rootfs. Common options:

| Distribution | Release | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| `alpine` | `3.21`, `3.23` | Minimal footprint, fast startup |
| `ubuntu` | `22.04`, `24.04` | Full-featured, large ecosystem |
| `debian` | `bookworm`, `trixie` | Stable, well-tested |
| `fedora` | `39`, `40` | Modern packages |

### Process Environment and Working Directory

The `process.cwd` and `process.env` fields from the standard schema are honored inside the container:

| Field | LXC Implementation | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| `process.cwd` | `cd -- "$1" && exec /bin/sh -c "$2"` wrapper prelude, with the cwd passed as a positional argument | Empty string preserves the container default cwd. A nonexistent or non-permitted path surfaces as a generic non-zero exit (typically `1`, from `cd`'s own status); callers needing strong cwd validation should pre-check the path. The positional-arg trick means cwd values with spaces, quotes, `$vars`, or backticks pass through verbatim with no shell escaping. |
| `process.env` | Each `KEY=VAL` entry becomes a repeated `--set-var=KEY=VAL` flag to `lxc-attach` | Malformed entries — those without `=` (e.g. `"BADENTRY"`) or with an empty key (e.g. `"=foo"`) — are silently skipped. Embedded `=` in the value (e.g. `"X=a=b=c"`) is preserved. |

**Replace semantics.** When `process.env` is non-empty, `lxc-exec` also passes `--clear-env` to `lxc-attach` so the host environment does **not** leak into the sandbox, regardless of how many entries survive the malformed-skip. This is the posture `lxc-attach(1)` recommends for sandbox-spawn callers. If a variable is set in both the host and `process.env`, the `process.env` value wins.

When `process.env` is empty (or absent), the legacy keep-env behavior is preserved and the host environment is inherited.

**Residual baseline.** Even with `--clear-env`, `lxc-attach` injects a small baseline (`container`, `HOME`, `TERM`, a default `PATH`, `USER`) and applies any `lxc.environment` entries from the container config. These layers sit below the user vars from `process.env`.

## Filesystem Policy

Filesystem policies are enforced via bind mounts in the container configuration:

| Policy | LXC Implementation | Effect |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| `readwritePaths` | `bind,rw` mount entry | Script can read and write |
| `readonlyPaths` | `bind,ro` mount entry | Script can read but not write |
| `deniedPaths` | No mount / tmpfs overlay | Path is not accessible in container |

## Network Policy

Network policies are enforced with parallel `iptables` and `ip6tables` chains scoped to the container's virtual ethernet (veth) interface:

| Policy | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| `defaultPolicy: "block"` | Final DROP rule in the container chain |
| `defaultPolicy: "allow"` | Final ACCEPT rule in the container chain |
| `allowedHosts` | ACCEPT rules for IP literals, CIDR blocks, or resolved hostnames |
| `blockedHosts` | DROP rules for IP literals, CIDR blocks, or resolved hostnames |

`allowedHosts` and `blockedHosts` entries may be bare IPv4/IPv6 literals, IPv4/IPv6 CIDR blocks, or hostnames. Hostnames are resolved to both A and AAAA records; IPv4 destinations are applied to the `iptables` chain and IPv6 destinations are applied to the `ip6tables` chain. Entries whose CIDR prefix is out of range for its family (or otherwise malformed) are reported as unresolved and skipped, leaving the rest of the policy in force. Host-list rules match all ports and protocols; port- and protocol-specific egress rules are not supported.

Before programming the IPv6 chain, MXC probes `ip6tables` with a read-only `ip6tables -S` and classifies the result three ways:

| Classification | Condition | Behavior |
|----------------|-----------|----------|
| `Available` | The `ip6tables` probe succeeds | Programs the parallel `ip6tables` chain alongside the IPv4 chain |
| `KernelIpv6Disabled` | The probe fails **and** the host has no active IPv6 | Skips the IPv6 chain and logs that there is no IPv6 egress to filter — safe, because there is nothing to filter |
| `UnusableButIpv6Active` | The probe fails **and** the host has active IPv6 | **Fails firewall setup** rather than applying an IPv4-only policy that would silently leave IPv6 egress unfiltered |

Host IPv6 activity is read from `/proc/net/if_inet6`: a non-loopback interface with an IPv6 address counts as active, while loopback-only `::1` on `lo` (present even on IPv4-only hosts) does not. If that file cannot be read at all — as opposed to being absent, which means IPv6 is disabled — the state is treated as *unknown* rather than as a confirmed "IPv6 is off", so an unreadable IPv6 state fails closed instead of leaving IPv6 unfiltered.

The chains are hooked into `FORWARD` for container egress by matching the host-side veth as the input interface. If MXC cannot discover the container veth, it skips the `FORWARD` hook with a warning rather than applying host-wide rules.

Firewall state is torn down automatically with best-effort removal of the `FORWARD` hooks and both per-container chains; there is no network-policy opt-out field. Setup failures after partial creation are rolled back before returning an error, so retries do not trip over leftover chains.

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
# Run with config file
./lxc-exec config.json

# Run with base64-encoded config
./lxc-exec --config-base64 <base64-string>

# Run with debug output
./lxc-exec --debug config.json

# Delete a container
./lxc-exec --delete --containername my-sandbox
```

### SDK

```typescript
import { spawnSandbox, SandboxPolicy } from '@microsoft/mxc-sdk';

const policy: SandboxPolicy = {
    filesystem: {
        readwritePaths: ['/tmp/output'],
        readonlyPaths: ['/opt/tools'],
    },
    network: {
        allowOutbound: false,
    },
};

// On Linux, this automatically uses lxc-exec
const pty = spawnSandbox('echo hello', policy);
pty.onData((data) => console.log(data));
pty.onExit((e) => console.log('Exit:', e.exitCode));
```
