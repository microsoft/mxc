# PLM — Permissive Learning Mode

`plm.exe` is the Windows-only trace driver for permissive learning mode. Long-form, it captures the access-denied events emitted by Windows' permissive sandbox layer, decodes them into structured findings, and merges those findings back into an MXC container config so the next enforcing run succeeds.

This PR introduces **capability extraction**: `EventID=14` DACL ACE blobs are decoded into AppContainer capability names via `extract_caps`, and those names are merged into the config's containment-backend `capabilities` array (when the backend supports it). UI relaxation arrives in a subsequent PR.

PLM is invoked automatically by [`wxc-exec --audit`](../../../README.md#audit-mode-permissive-learning-mode); the standalone CLI documented here is for capturing traces, interactive iteration, and debugging the parser itself.

## How it works

1. **Capture** — `plm start` calls `wpr -start <plm.wprp>!AccessFailureProfile -filemode`, enabling the `Microsoft-Windows-Privacy-Auditing-PermissiveLearningMode` and `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` ETW providers in a secure realtime collector.
2. **Run** — the operator runs the workload. The OS-side permissive sandbox logs `EventID=14` / `EventID=27` for every access that *would* have been denied.
3. **Stop** — `plm stop` calls `wpr -stop <trace.etl>` and walks the `.etl` with `EvtQuery` / `EvtRender`.
4. **Parse** — for each `EventID=14`, the parser pulls the file path / access mask and decodes the DACL ACE blob into AppContainer capability names. `EventID=27` UI relaxation lands in a later PR.
5. **Merge** — file paths are added to `filesystem.readwritePaths` / `filesystem.readonlyPaths`; capability names are added to the containment-backend's `capabilities` array; results are written as `Adjusted_<name>.json` next to the captured trace.

## CLI

### `plm start`

Cancels any in-progress WPR session and starts a new permissive-learning-mode trace.

```powershell
plm.exe start [--wprp <path>]
```

| Flag       | Default                | Purpose                                                       |
|------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--wprp`   | `<exe dir>\plm.wprp`   | Override the WPR profile path. By default `plm` materializes its embedded profile next to the exe on first use; an existing `plm.wprp` is never overwritten, so operator hand-edits are preserved. |

### `plm stop`

Stops the active trace (or accepts a previously captured one).

```powershell
plm.exe stop [--config-path <path>] [--log-dir <path>] [--bin-path <path>]
             [--trace-file <path>] [--verbose-logging]
```

`--config-path` drives an in-memory merge of discovered file paths and capabilities against the input config and persists the result as `Adjusted_<name>.json` in the log directory. The adjusted config is written next to the operator's config snapshot in `--log-dir`; there is deliberately no flag to redirect it to an arbitrary path, because `plm.exe` runs elevated and an operator-named output path would be an admin-privileged arbitrary-write primitive. The write is atomic (temp file in the same directory, then rename over the destination) so a downstream enforcing run never observes a truncated policy.

### `plm extract-caps`

Decode a raw hex-encoded DACL ACE buffer into a sorted list of AppContainer capability names. Useful for debugging the ACE decoder against ETW payloads dumped by other tools.

```powershell
plm.exe extract-caps --hex-bytes <hex> [--verbose-logging]
```

### `plm log`

Interactive iteration mode: press Enter to start a trace, run the workload, press Enter again to stop. It then synthesizes a blank config, runs the filesystem merge, and prints the resulting config as a "diff against a blank config" preview.

```powershell
plm.exe log [--wprp <path>] [--verbose-logging]
```

## Building

PLM is part of the MXC workspace but excluded from `default-members` because it's Windows-only. Build it explicitly:

```powershell
cd C:\src\mxc\src
cargo build -p plm --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
# or for release:
cargo build -p plm --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --release
```

The WPR profile is embedded into `plm.exe` itself (see `src/profile_gen.rs`); on first use of `plm start` / `plm log`, `profile_gen::ensure_wprp_next_to_exe` writes it to disk next to the binary if no `plm.wprp` is already present. `build.bat` from the repo root builds `plm.exe` and stages it next to `wxc-exec.exe` for the `--audit` integration.

## Limitations

- **Windows-only.** Uses `wpr.exe` and Job-Object UI-limit semantics that have no portable equivalent.
- **Deny matching is enforced on literal, lexically-normalized paths only.** `config::normalize_path` strips verbatim/device prefixes, lowercases, collapses separators, and rejects ADS / `.` / `..`, but it is filesystem-free and does **not** resolve directory junctions, symlinks/reparse points, or 8.3 short names. 8.3 short-name aliases of a denied directory are detected lexically and refused promotion (fail-closed), but a junction/symlink alias (e.g. `C:\work\link` → `C:\Secrets`) is a lexically distinct path that will **not** match a deny entry and can therefore be promoted into the persisted `Adjusted_*.json`. Operators must deny the canonical target path; aliasing the target through a reparse point is a known gap. See the deny-matching code in `src/config.rs`.
- **No UI extraction yet.** `plm stop` writes `Adjusted_<name>.json` with the discovered file paths and AppContainer capabilities. UI-policy extraction (`EventID=27`) arrives in a subsequent PR.
